I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of California Santa Cruz. I have the pleasure of being advised by [Daniel Fremont](https://people.ucsc.edu/~dfremont/index.html). 

As an undergraduate, I had the privilege to work under [Katia Obraczka](https://inrg.soe.ucsc.edu/) on the [PIMAP](https://inrg.soe.ucsc.edu/project-pimap-pressure-injury-monitoring-and-prevention/) project.
